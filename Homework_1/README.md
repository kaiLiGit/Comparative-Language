# Comparative-Language Homework#1
## This homework project requires building a basic interpreter to translate and execute Z+- (a made-up language) using Java/C++. 
> Since I am more comfortable with Java, I decided to use Java to complete this project. 
> All files with .zpm extension are the testing files and input files to be interpreted by the interpreter software. 
> The main method resides in MyProgram.java.
