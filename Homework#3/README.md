# Homework3 
## Functional Programming using Scheme
> Homework detail requirements specified in code comments in each file. 
> Each function in each file is completed by the descriptions provided in the comments 
> hw3.pdf is the expected output
* Running the program using command in unix / Linux environment (provided scheme compiler is downloaded): 
  - scheme48 -h 8000000 < hw3.scm 
* The file salesBig.scm. Currently, hw3.scm loads the file sales.scm. You will need to modify line 100 in the hw3.scm file
(load "sales.scm") to load a different input file. The submitted hw3.scm file should load sales.scm.

>  [hw3.pdf](https://github.com/kaiLiGit/Comparative-Language/blob/master/Homework%233/hw3.pdf) shows the expected output.
